                    “There is no way the school will close.” “We will only be closed for a few weeks and be back by
                    finals.” “There is no way next semester will be online.” All these naïve statements we made over a
                    year ago now sound incredible given how this pandemic has played out for CSUCI students. Very few
                    people had any sort of idea of what we were about to go through as an education community.

                    Being in the Computer Science field, and specifically doing a capstone that was centered around
                    Software Engineering, I had already expected a mostly independent experience completing my capstone
                    project since before COIVD-19 even existed. My expectation was always that I would be working on my
                    capstone, reporting my progress periodically to my advisor, and receiving useful feedback to apply
                    in my further work. This is, after all, the entire philosophy around iterative software engineering.
                    Because of this, the pandemic did not necessarily affect the capstone process in a direct way. This
                    does not mean that the capstone was not affected by the pandemic, of course.

                    The circumstances surrounding the capstone caused by the pandemic are what applied the most amount
                    of pressure. In personal circumstances, the plans for my parents, who I live with, to sell the house
                    and move had been moved from the summer to right in the middle of the semester, so that added a long
                    period of time where my attention had to be split between my school and work responsibilities as
                    well as packing, moving, and setting up the new house. Asynchronous learning was not much of a help
                    either. What started out as Zoom lectures at the same time the in-person lectures would have been
                    devolved into basically having to be my own professor for 5 classes. If anything, online learning
                    has greatly deepened my appreciation for live synchronous learning. As the professors seemed to
                    become more comfortable with asynchronous classes, the more I noticed the pattern of “read the
                    textbook, do an assignment, take a quiz, and do a discussion, then repeat next week” and how
                    impersonal that experience felt. For several professors, I have no idea what they look like, sound
                    like, what their teaching style is, or even how to pronounce their names. This applies even more for
                    my peers, most of which I have never met and will likely never meet in my life. What was once such
                    an incredible learning environment with a wonderful community of students and professors working
                    together to build an education experience that I will cherish for my entire life, became me sitting
                    alone in my room trying to keep up with all my assignments each week. It was demoralizing. I reached
                    a point to where the simple thought of my capstone project filled me with anxiety as it became just
                    another asynchronous class, rather than the culmination of what I have learned in my undergraduate.
                    This resulted in me losing about a month worth of work on this project as I simply could not bring
                    myself to even open my code editor to get to work. I eventually had to hunker down with an unhealthy
                    amount of energy drinks to get my project to a state in which not only would receive good scores,
                    but that I can personally be proud of and stand as a testament to my software engineering abilities
                    that this school has helped me improve so much.

                    This capstone project was meant to teach me more about software engineering, but it taught me so
                    much more. I believe all of us had tough lessons to learn this last year about valuing our social
                    connections, acknowledging our own privileges and the blind spots they create in our world view,
                    about holding ourselves accountable for the work we do. Though I may be leaving CSUCI soon, I am
                    happy to know that students next semester will finally be able to enjoy the school campus and the
                    wonderful learning experience that comes with it once again.
